***Hello !***

This is my first project on GitHub - a Data Science portfolio on data analysis.

Throughout this course on Codecademy, i have learned an enormous amount of knowledge of Data Science, and also with my own research on other projects of this field, i have also gathered skills to take the analysis thoroughly.

It's not much to analyze, and my analysis questions are rather 'shallow', it's my effort put into this portfolio, and i am happy to have your feedbacks on it !

***Thanks all !***
